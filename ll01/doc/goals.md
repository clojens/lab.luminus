1. conceptualize a extension system for the luminus web framework for clojure;
1. locate, study, discuss and evaluate existing solutions are the concepts of:
   pluggable architecture, hooking project function handlers, inject/build
   dependency trees, share code/data through the project, determine events,
   signaling of events/triggers, messaging/logging backend, componentized
   html/web forms, dynamic components versus static generated resources,
   dependency graphs, mutable state, run-time/engines, renderers etcetera.
1. provide pseudo-code/snippets to demonstrate/illustrate concepts, get
   concrete decision making going, exclude and adopt ideas for further
   research
1. determine finally a plan of attack with a initial feature description,
   having sorted out initial ideas to be either in core architecture,
   internally created plugins/extensions, or left for third party to
   work on
1. document the entire process to the best extent possible, with sufficient
   references for any future work in this direction, wether it be luminus
   or the Clojure community in general, as a reflection on the current
   situation in the landscape + possible development notions for the
   future directions things may take
